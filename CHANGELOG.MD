### ***1.0.3***

Recipe Changes:
* Updates/fixes for load conditions.
* Certain mixing recipes now use "c:crushed_raw_xxx" instead of "c:xxx_dusts" to prevent duplication with mods (Industrial Revolution, Modern Industrialization, Tech Reborn) that can turn ingots into dust.
* Recipes for melting ingots back to their molten form.
* Support for Ad Astra's Steel.

### ***1.0.2***

* Content for Industrial Revolution (Tungsten, Electrum, Nikolite, and Enriched Nikolite). 

Note: When used together, this mod disables the overlapping molten fluids and uses the ones found in Industrial Revolution.

* Content for Ad Astra (Calorite, Desh, and Ostrum)
* Content for Minecraft (Andesite)
* Content for Create (Andesite Alloy, Brass, and Zinc)
